Better static assert messages for `std.algorithm.comparison.equal`

Until now, `equal` used a template constraint to check if the passed types
could be used. If they were not, it was very tedious to figure out why.

As the template constraint is not used for overload resolution
the constrains are moved into static asserts with expressive error
messages.
