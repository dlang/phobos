variant: Support big structs with @disabled this()

std.variant didn't compile when the payload was a struct that was bigger than
its internal buffer and had to be allocated on the heap if that struct
`@disabled this()`. The new handling now always skips the constructor and just
copies the directly to the allocated regions.
