Added the `SharedBitmappedBlock`, as the thread-safe version of the regular `BitmappedBlock`.

The limitation of the new $(REF SharedBitmappedBlock, std,experimental,allocator,building_blocks,bitmapped_block)
implementation is that the shared version can only allocate
at most one block per allocation. This however allows for greater performance, because
the synchronization is done at a single block level, whereas for multiple blocks the whole
bit array should have been synchronized by means of wide locking.
